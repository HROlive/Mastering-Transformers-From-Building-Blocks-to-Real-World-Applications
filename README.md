## Description

For the past five years, the amount of transformer-based architectures has grown significantly and keeps dominating the deep learning domain nowadays. They can be considered another leap innovation that pushes the boundaries in deep neural network performance and scalability further. They have been demonstrated with the largest models using over half a trillion parameters and scaled up to thousands of GPUs.

In this course, participants learn the building blocks of transformer architectures in order to apply them to their own projects. These novel methods will be differentiated against existing methods, showing their advantages and disadvantages. Different hands-on exercises give the participants room to explore how the transformers work in different fields of application.
